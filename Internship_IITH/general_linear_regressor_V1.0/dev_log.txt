-BUG 1
    Observed - Values of x_at_min and y_min lock up for some values of initial_x 
    and propagate through to the next iteration. 
    - This dosent happen if the uut itself is reset after prior to every iteration
    - I think its something to do with the improper intialization of internal 
    variabels after iteration  
    - I need to figure out which of them are not geting intialized properly
        - I think maybe it x_at_min_inter and y_min_inter

-After strugelling with the Vivado software to get my block diagram compiled, it
finally did
- The error seemed to have been:
    - long path to verilog design sources which went over 80 characters
    - "Is Include" in the file groups of the grad_descent Module Packaging,
    do not explicitly Include the source files and let the packager do it automatically

-I created the Bitstream for 2 more versions,
    - Due to the combinatorial Multiplications, a lot of delay was added in the 
    synthesized design meaning it couldnt be run at the rate 100 Mhz speed, and was 
    down graded to run at 5 Mhz instead.
    - In V_1 i ran the whole of PL (interconnect, reset and uut) at 5 Mhz
    - In V_2 i ran the uut at 5 Mhz and everything else at 100 MHz and used the 
    interconnect to cross clock domains
- Now that the project is synthesized, i can call this v1.0 progect over and completed.
i have been given a different polynomial to simulate, but being of the 4th order my data
width is simply not enough.
- In v2.0 of this code i would like to:
    - Add sequntial Multiplications
    - Make the the default function a 5th order polynomial
    - Make it so that only the coefficents need to be changed when defining the 
    polynomial
