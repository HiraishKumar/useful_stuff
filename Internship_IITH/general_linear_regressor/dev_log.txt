-BUG 1
    Observed - Values of x_at_min and y_min lock up for some values of initial_x 
    and propagate through to the next iteration. 
    - This dosent happen if the uut itself is reset after prior to every iteration
    - I think its something to do with the improper intialization of internal 
    variabels after iteration  
    - I need to figure out which of them are not geting intialized properly
        - I think maybe it x_at_min_inter and y_min_inter
