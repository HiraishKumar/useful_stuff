- GOAL OF PROGECT:
    - Expand Default polynomial to the 5th order
    - Add Sequential Multiply 
    - Imporve Gradient Descemt Algo using LMS.

13 MAY 2025:
    - Pipelined the 4th order polynomial for 5 Stage Computation 
    - wrote a test bench for the  4th order polynomial
    - need to implement a 128 * 32 bit Multiplier for cont multiplication
    - I would like to enjoy my weekend tommorow so we'll see 

16 MAY 2025:
    - {DONE} Make a 128 * 128 = 128 bit fixed point multiplier
    - {DONE} Test and implement it in the func Module
    - {DONE} Run Tests on the Func Module
